The Packard Humanities Institute files come from Christian Askeland.  He writes:
"PHI Coptic files are in the attachment (Bible and NHC).Â  You theoretically request the CD for free, but I don't think that this really works out anymore."

PHI has been rather adamant about people not reproducing their work whole cloth.  If we want to include Nag Hammadi we need to do some kind of editing.
