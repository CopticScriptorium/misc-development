Questions for David and Andrew
How much information in the notes about transcription, collation, anything else do you think is important?

Is your edition of I See Your Eagerness the intellectual property of the press?  We are currently only publishing out of print editions and diplomatic editions for intellectual property reasons as well as disciplinary interests -- people seem to want dipl editions. But for our workflow, we can machine process the edition better than the diplomatic (Because we can tokenize the edition.  Then we can make it look like the diplomatic version with manual editing.)

Describe work flow -- diplomatic into Excel (more time consuming) or take edition, then diplomaticize it in Excel.  

Published editions (such as Shisha-Halevy's) that are under copyright:  you have done your own editorial work by collating against the original manuscript, correct?


NOTE:  I should mark what we've looked at on photos vs manuscripts
